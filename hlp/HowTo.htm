<h1 align="center">How To Use <i>Fit To List</i></h1>
<h3><b>1) Select </b>photos to crop or reduce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Click the left-most button on the toolbar to select the photos you
want to crop and/or reduce. Choose the folder where your photos reside. An
alternate way to select photos is to drag a single photo to the program and drop
it anywhere within the display area. The program will retrieve all photos from
the folder where the dragged photo resides. Your photos must have a file
extension of 'jpg'. For example, MyPicture.jpg, is a valid photo file. Photos
that do not have a 'jpg' extension will not work with <i>Fit To List</i>. Most
digital cameras produce 'jpg' files. The name of the folder containing your
originals will be displayed on the information bar at the top of the
program.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&nbsp;2) (Optional) Select where to store your processed photos. Set how
much image reduction.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Most people can skip this step and move to step 3. The program is
preconfigured to store your processed photos in a folder on your desktop. Image
reduction is already set to good values for web pages and emails. But you can
change the standard settings if you wish. <i>Fit To List</i> will remember your
custom settings. You will not need to perform this step again as long as you are
satisfied with your custom settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Select Processed Folder</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click the second button on the toolbar to set photo
processing options. Specify the folder to
contain your processed photos, and the amount you want your photos reduced. A
drop down list gives you three choices of where to store your processed photos:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A folder called 'FitToList Photos' on your desktop.</li>
  <li>A folder called 'Processed' located within the folder that contains your
    originals.</li>
  <li>A folder you specify using the 'Browse' button. The drop down will always
    contain the last folder you specified using 'Browse' so you can quickly
    select it later.</li>
</ol>
<p>Select one of the three locations for your processed photos. If you select
option 2 or 3 above and it cannot be used because it is write protected (i.e. your
photos are on a CD or a camera memory card), the program will automatically
switch to option 1. If there is a conflict with option 1, <i>Fit To List</i>
will store your processed photos in your 'My Pictures' folder. The information
bar at the top of the program will always display the location of your processed
photos.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Set Image Reduction</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can set a maximum size for your processed photos. If an original
photo is larger than the dimensions you choose, it will be copied and reduced.
The reduced copy will be stored in the processed folder. The original photo will
not be altered. The program will always preserve the aspect ratio of the
original to keep the picture from being distorted. This means processed photos
will not always have the exact dimensions you pick, but they will never exceed
those dimensions. Do not worry about which dimension is height and which is
width. Usually you hold your camera level, but sometimes you turn it sideways to
photograph a tree or other tall object. <i>Fit To List</i> will automatically
swap your height and width dimensions when necessary in order to preserve the
aspect ratio of your original picture.</p>
<h3>3) Process your Photos</h3>
<p>There are two ways to process your photos; one at a time manually, or as a
batch unattended. If you need to crop your photos, process them one at a time
manually. If you need only to make your photos suitable for emails or the web,
process them as a batch.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><b>Crop &amp; Resize Manually</b></h3>

</blockquote>
<p> Your photos appear in the
Navigation Tree on the left side of the screen in a folder called 'Photos To
Size'. Click on a photo name to view
that photo on the screen. Position your cursor on the picture, hold down your
mouse button, and drag the mouse to draw a rectangle on the picture. This is
your cropping rectangle. You can size the rectangle by dragging its edges. You
can position your cursor inside the rectangle and drag your mouse to move the
entire rectangle.&nbsp; Position the rectangle so it includes the area of the
picture you wish to keep. Double click you mouse within the rectangle to crop
the picture. Click your mouse once outside the rectangle to make the rectangle
disappear. If you double click the picture when no rectangle is visible, you
will resize the entire picture without cropping it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When you double click the picture, the 'Save Picture' pop-up appears to
verify you are ready to crop and/or resize the currently displayed picture.. The
screen contains four fields:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<b>Picture is for web or email' </b>  check box<b>:</b>  Check
this box if you intend to include the picture as an email attachment or in a web
page. <i> Fit To List</i> will check the size of the image before writing it to the
processed folder. If it is too large, the image will be reduced to a size that
is better for use on the internet (See the section 'Set Image Reduction' above). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Name:</b> Enter the file name the processed image
should have. It defaults to the name of the original photo.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 'Save In' </b>  drop down<b>:</b>  You can save processed images
in the same folder as your original images, or in a separate processed folder
(Recommended).&nbsp;&nbsp;If you save in the originals folder, you could
overwrite an original image if you name your processed image with the same name.
<i>
Fit To List</i> will warn you before you do this however. The location of the
processed folder is displayed in the information bar at the top of the screen.
You can change this location using a toolbar button as described above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> 'Go to next picture' </b>  check box<b>:</b>  If you are only
making one image out of each original photo, select the 'Go to next picture'
option. If checked, <i> Fit To List</i> will automatically advance to the next photo
after you crop and save the current picture. If you plan to crop the same photo
several times to turn one picture into many, leave this option unchecked.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <h3><b>Batch Resize All Photos</b></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Click the 'Resize All' button on the toolbar to reduce all images listed in
the 'Photos To Size' folder in the Navigation Tree on the left side of the
screen. Photos that are too large for use on the web will be reduced. Photos
that are smaller than the maximum size will be copied to the processed folder
unaltered. The aspect ratio of all photos will be preserved. Photos orientated
both vertically and horizontally can be mixed in the same batch. <i> Fit To List</i>
will automatically swap length and width values to preserve the aspect ratio of
the original photos. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Set Size</b> button - Set the maximum size for an
image. Images smaller than these dimensions will not be affected. Reduced images
may not match these dimensions exactly. The aspect ratio of the original image
will be preserved. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Save In </b>drop down: Select a folder to for your
processed photos. The drop down offers three folder choices; a folder on your
desktop called 'Fit To List Photos', a folder within the originals folder called
'Processed', or a folder that you choose using the 'Browse' button. The drop
down remembers your last browse choice for quick selection later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Ask before overwriting images</b>: If the box is
checked, <i>Fit To List</i> will stop processing photos if it detects it is
about to overwrite an existing photo. You will be prompted to overwrite the
photo (Yes), skip the photo (No), or stop processing photos (Cancel). If the box
is not checked, <i>Fit To List</i> will not prompt you. Instead, it will
overwrite photos that have the same name in the processed folder.</p>
