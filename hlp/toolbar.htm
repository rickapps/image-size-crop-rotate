        folder to store your reduced, processed images. The drop down list gives
        you three choices of where to store your processed photos:
        <ol>
          <li>In a folder on your desktop called 'FitToList Photos'</li>
          <li>In a folder called 'Processed', located inside the folder
            containing your original photos&nbsp;</li>
          <li>In a folder you pick by clicking the 'Browse' button. The drop
            down will display the last folder you picked. If processed photos
            cannot be stored in the chosen folder, the program will put them in
            the 'FitToList Photos' folder on your desktop instead.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can also set the maximum dimensions for processed images. Original pictures that exceed these dimensions will be reduced
        to make them suitable for web or email use. The reduced images will be
        stored in the processed folder you select. The original images will not
        be affected. If an original is already smaller than the size you select,
        it will be copied to the processed folder without a change in size.
