Here's a no-frills photo editor that works effortlessly. A simple main window offers all the functions at a button-touch, and resembles a basic browser window. Fit to List offers only the most essential features of photo editing, including image rotation, flip, resize, and crop. There aren't any color filters, or special effects to choose from. Once you've chosen which files to work with, images are displayed as thumbnails, although there also is an option to view at full size. If you're working with a lot of images at once, Fit to List can make changes in batches fairly easily. Overall, a decent program that will be worth the small investment for those who need basic features for large projects. 


Fit to List reduces your photos for use on eBay, email, or web pages. It allows you to crop, rotate, resize, and bulk resize your JPEG pictures. The photo editor does not support more advanced photo enhancements, but it does add workflow to the editing process. The program makes it obvious which photos are ready to upload and which photos require attention. When you crop a photo, Fit to List checks the image and reduces it if it is still too large for eBay or web pages. It preserves the original aspect ratio and keeps the image focused and clear. You can resize large numbers of photos unattended. If you have dozens of scanner images, or digital-camera photos to crop that only require basic photo editing or image reduction, Fit to List will save you hours.
